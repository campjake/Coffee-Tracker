# Coffee-Tracker
Make the perfect cup of coffee every day by tracking it!

The Coffee Tracker will allow you to keep track of how you make coffee.

The user should be able to easily log their best coffees and reference them in the future for the perfect serving every time!

### Some Thoughts At The Beginning
This application will be targeted at people who grind their own beans. The variables in making coffee is similar to bread, you just can't keep track of everything.
So we will aim to focus more on those who have a burr grinder and can more consistently grind coffee beans to a certain fineness day-to-day.

### Notes & Resources
The Coffee Tracker will be made using C#, which I am learning as I go for this project. My fundamentals were learned in C++ so the shift to a .NET language is
exciting, but will be filled with lessons along the way. Please contribute if you have any constructive feedback or advice
